We introduce and analyze in detail a 2D and 3D quantitative multiscale model that describes the growth and epigenetic evolution of an avascular breast tumor. We obtain series of microarrays that describe the activation/inhibit levels of a group of genes that respond to the occurrence of oxygen and estrogen concentration gradients. We identify three cell phenotypes: normal, precancer and cancer, that are crucial to understand the tumor structure, the spatial distribution of mutations and the tumor heterogeneity. Finally, we found that the estrogen concentration gradients are related to the variation of gene expression levels and phenotypes occurrence. These findings strongly suggest that it is possible to develop epigenetic cancer treatment alternatives to either stop or reverse tumor evolution.
